	<p>This is the first new building to be constructed on the golden Mile, Blackpool for many years. it provides a focal point for visitors, and contains a very unusual mix of uses: a large restaurant and local information office at promenade level, with registry offices and ceremony hall for weddings above.</p>
	<p>Designed with dRMM, tower Festival Headland pursues de Rijkeâ€™s cross- laminated timber (CLt) research agenda, which promotes the adoption by the British construction industry, of high performance, low environmental impact structural timber, locally sourced. A greater use of this building material would help the uK achieve its eu Co2 reduction targets, while providing the strength and safety of conventionally constructed buildings.</p>
